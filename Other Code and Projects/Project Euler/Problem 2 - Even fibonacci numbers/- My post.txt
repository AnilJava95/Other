I tried to find out a smart way of doing it but all i could find out was 2 is even, after 2 every 2
 number is odd and the number after these 2 odd numbers is even(even odd odd even odd odd even odd
 odd ...). I tried to calculate these even numbers using a (xa + yb) system. 1 = a, 2 = b, 3 = a+b,
 5 = 1+2b etc. And i wanted to find a correlation between coefficients of a's and b's of even
 numbers but i don't think there is one. Also it turned out using this route was going to be the
 same thing as just calculating the normal series. But i gotta say even finding huge even fibonacci
 numbers just take few iterations so i guess its ok to brute force. So here it is:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	
	int fibonacci0 = 1;
	int fibonacci1 = 2;
	int sum = 0;
	
	while( fibonacci1 < 4000000)
	{
		if(fibonacci1 % 2 == 0)
		{
			sum += fibonacci1;
			printf("even number: %d   sum: %d\n", fibonacci1, sum);
		}
		
		fibonacci1 += fibonacci0;
		fibonacci0 = fibonacci1 - fibonacci0;
	}
	
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
