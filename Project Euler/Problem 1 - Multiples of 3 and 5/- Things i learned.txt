You can do it with different approaches that are more or less brute force(especially for high input 
amounts). So it is better to come up with equations that find sum of numbers like 3 + 6 + 9 ... 999. 
You can use the equation sum of numbers from 1 to n is (n(n+1)) / 2. and you can write the numbers like
3( 1 + 2 + 3 ... 333) etc. so 3 . ((333 . 334) / 2)


Summary: Instead of implementing the first thing that came up to your brain, you can try to come up with
 better solutions that are better.(not brute force. which means faster with high amounts of input.)
