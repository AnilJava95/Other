First i created a brute force c algorithm and saved the prime factors in an array. But it was extremely
 slow. Once i got the arrays out of my code and just printed the prime factors my code got MUCH 
 faster(especially for big inputs)

[code]
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	
	long long number, halfTheNumber, primeNumberCounter = 2;
	
	printf("Enter number to find its prime factors: ");
	scanf("%llu", &number);
	
	halfTheNumber = number / 2;
	for(; primeNumberCounter <= halfTheNumber; primeNumberCounter++)
	{
		while(number % primeNumberCounter == 0)
		{
			number /= primeNumberCounter;
			printf("%llu ", primeNumberCounter);
		}
	}
	
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
[/code]

I would suggest you to open an algorithm design and analysis book and read the first sentence. The sentence that describes what an algorithm is.
